# What is TextGO?

TextGO is a cross-platform desktop application designed to help you quickly recognize and process text through simple operations. You can select text in any application and trigger preset text processing actions using hotkeys, double-click, or drag-select, greatly improving work efficiency.

## Core Philosophy

> Simplify text processing and boost productivity

In daily work, we often need to process text in various ways, such as:

- Remove extra spaces and line breaks from selected text
- Convert code variable naming styles
- Search selected text on a specific website
- Analyze text content using AI
- ...

TextGO allows you to quickly complete these text processing tasks through simple configuration, without switching apps or manually copying and pasting.

## Workflow

TextGO's workflow is very simple:

```
1. Select text
   ↓
2. Trigger (hotkeys/double-click/drag-select)
   ↓
3. Recognize type (match rules)
   ↓
4. Execute action (silent/toolbar)
   ↓
5. View result (replace/popup)
```
